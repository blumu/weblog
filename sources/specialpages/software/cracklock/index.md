============================

<script text="text/javascript" src="latestVersion.js" > </script>

Cracklock is a unique tool designed to protect you from a particularly vicious polymorphic virus
affecting an ever-growing number of shareware programs.
This virus, known as the "30th day virus", typically manifests itself 30 days after the installation of your
infected software and basically prevents it from starting up! Often a warning message accompanies this suspicious behaviour. 
Cracklock cures your programs using cutting-edge technology that are still unknown to other anti-virus vendors (McAfee, Norton, 
Sophos, Thunderbyte, F-Proot...).

Cracklock can be used for other purposes as well, for instance developers have used it to certify their
software for "Year 2000" compliance. Since then we've improved Cracklock and are now proud to announce that
it can also certify your software against the Y10K bug (aka "bug of the year 10000"). Thanks to Cracklock those bugs
have all become a problem of the past.

Lastly Cracklock offers a [new feature](changelog-web.html) to work around the 
["Microsoft Outlook timezone bug"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=outlook%20timezone%20problem)!

![Help](images/help.gif) Documentation
--------------------------------------

The english documentation is available [here](xmldoc/cracklock-doc-web.html). 
For other languages an older version of the documentation is available: 

* [English](help/english/index.html)
* [Spanish](help/spanish/index.html) 
* [French](help/french/index.html) 
* [Arabic](help/arabic/index.html)

Contributing to the translation
-------------------------------

The translation tool I once developped ([RLGui](../others/index.html#rlgui)) is now deprecated. Although it had nice features (for instance it can automatically reuse strings translated for version n of a program to generate translation for version n+1), it required me to do some postprocessing after each translator had finished his job.
 From now on, if you want to make a new translation of Cracklock, use any resource editor available on the net ([Resource Hacker](http://www.users.on.net/johnson/resourcehacker/), [Resource Explorer](http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d7resourceexplorer.htm) or Microsoft Visual Studio) and edit one of the file in the 'Language' subdirectory of Cracklock (e.g. CLRESUS.DLL for the english version) then save it under another name (e.g. CLRESGE.DLL for german) in the same directory. After restarting Cracklock Manager, the newly created language will appear under the Language menu.
