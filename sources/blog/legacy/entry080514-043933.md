# Synchronizing PDF files with Latex documentsÂ 
**Tuesday, 13 May 2008, 19:39**

_Posted by William Blum_

I am currently in the process of writing up my PhD thesis using Latex. I just realized how spoiled Mac users are when it comes to TeX tool support: nearly all Tex editors support viewing PDF files with source synchronization (
[iTeXMac2](http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/),

[TeXniscope](http://www2.ing.unipi.it/~d9615/homepage/texniscope.html),
[TeXShop](http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/),
[PDFViewer](http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/macosxutils/pdfviewer.html)). On the windows platform, until recently, not a single PDF viewer was capable of doing that including Acrobat, PDF-XChange Viewer, Foxit reader, and SumatraPDF.

Of course under the Windows platform we have the Yap DVI viewer that comes with the [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) 
distribution. Ah, Yap,... This crappy piece of software that becomes less and less usable as the version increases: poor responsiveness when browsing the document, no pre-caching of the images, polling the .dvi file thousands times a millisecond to check whether its content has changed instead of using the [proper](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365465(VS.85).aspx) Windows API, blocking of the .dvi file preventing latex from compiling, and last but not least: loads of modal error messages forcing you to switch to the mouse to get rid of them when you just want to be typing your latex document.

A quick [browsing journey on the web](http://magic.aladdin.cs.cmu.edu/2008/01/02/sumatrapdf-08-released/) suggested me that I was not the only person to feel that frustrated about the current TeX viewing facilities on Windows. But since no one seemed to be interested in implementing the desired features, I decided to give it a try.

So here we are: I have proposed several patches for [SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/) that were accepted by the author: the first one implements autorefresh: when you recompile your tex document to pdf, the viewer automatically refreshes itself without any need for user interaction.

The second feature is inverse-search synchronization based on [pdfsync](http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/pdfsync.html):
 when you double-click on the pdf file it brings you directly to the .tex source file corresponding to that location in the pdf. By default the [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/) editor is invoked. 
 This can be configured (Menu 'File\set inverse search command line'). For instance the string to start [TeXnicCenter](http://www.toolscenter.org/) is

    "C:\Program Files\TeXnicCenter\TEXCNTR.EXE" /ddecmd "[goto('%f', '%l')]"

For [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/) it is:

    "C:\Program Files\WinEdt Team\WinEdt\winedt.exe" "[Open(|%f|);SelPar(%l,8)]"

I have also updated [LatexDaemon](http://william.famille-blum.org/software/latexdaemon/index.html) to make it compatible with pdfsync.

If you want to give it a try, you can download the [binary file here](http://william.famille-blum.org/software/sumatra/SumatraPDF-sync.exe).
The changes to the source code have been submitted to the SVN repository at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/).
