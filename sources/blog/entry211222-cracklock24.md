Twenty-four years ago, on November, 1st 1997, I released the first version of Cracklock.
While going through some old USB drives, I recently stumbled across some zip files containing its sources.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cracklock is a [software tool](https://william.famille-blum.org/software/cracklock/) that helps overcome potential issues caused by the passing of time.
In some ways, you can think of Cracklock as a software adaptation of the [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day) movie.

Since its first release, I've often been asked to make it open source.
The number 24 is closely related to the notion of time so I decided to celebrate this important anniversary by releasing the sources on GitHub.

Beware of the code quality, this is fairly ancient material written by a young self-taught inexperienced kid.
Not mentioning the choice of programming language that indicates a serious lack of discernment.
Rust did not exist at the time but that's no excuse: I could have picked a [very decent programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) released just a year before Cracklock.
To my credit, I also could have done worse by using some [popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) [dynamically-typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), yak!
In any case, if you are interested, the sources are now available at [https://github.com/blumu/cracklock](https://github.com/blumu/cracklock).
Merry Christmas!
