Most TeX distributions (TeXLive 2008 and MikTex 2.7) have now been updated to support SyncTeX. The option is activated with the -synctex switch at the command-line as follows:

    pdflatex -synctex=-1 mybook.tex

This command produces a file name 'mybook.synctex' which can then be used to perform PDF<->TEX synchronization. The file can be large so you can instead produce a compressed version (mybook.synctex.gz) with:

    pdflatex -synctex=1 mybook.tex

The SyncTeX patch that I've developed is now maintained in the main development branch of SumatraPDF; it is part of the [latest official release (version 0.9.3)](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/download.html).

I will still continue to publish [my own builds](../../software/sumatra/SumatraPDF-sync.exe) of SumatraPDF to my website (the executable is updated regularly even though I am not posting about it): at the moment the only difference with the official release is the presence of a dialog box to let the user configure the inverse-search command. (In the official release this is done by passing command line parameters to SumatraPDF.exe.)

I wrote a [short documentation](static.php?page=static081010-000413) to help you configure your favourite editors for synchronization with SumatraPDF.
