This is the dual of the previous post: I have now implemented forward-search in SumatraPDF, i.e. the ability to go from the source .tex file to the corresponding location in the PDF. The communication between the TeX editor and SumatraPDF relies on the [DDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Data_Exchange) protocol. (Most TeX editors such as WinEdt and TeXnicCenter support it.)
