I am currently in the process of writing up my PhD thesis using Latex. I just realized how spoiled Mac users are when it comes to TeX tool support: nearly all Tex editors support viewing PDF files with source synchronization (
[iTeXMac2](http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/),

[TeXniscope](http://www2.ing.unipi.it/~d9615/homepage/texniscope.html),
[TeXShop](http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/),
[PDFViewer](http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/macosxutils/pdfviewer.html)). On the windows platform, until recently, not a single PDF viewer was capable of doing that including Acrobat, PDF-XChange Viewer, Foxit reader, and SumatraPDF.

Of course under the Windows platform we have the Yap DVI viewer that comes with the [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) 
distribution. Ah, Yap,... This crappy piece of software that becomes less and less usable as the version increases: poor responsiveness when browsing the document, no pre-caching of the images, polling the .dvi file thousands times a millisecond to check whether its content has changed instead of using the [proper](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365465(VS.85).aspx) Windows API, blocking of the .dvi file preventing latex from compiling, and last but not least: loads of modal error messages forcing you to switch to the mouse to get rid of them when you just want to be typing your latex document.
