This is a puzzle game where the goal is to rearrange rows of icons into pairs by swapping icons from one row to another.
There are multiple difficulty levels. The game is so addictive that Bill Gates once proposed me to release it with
Windows 95. Unfortunately for him, he was not rich enough to afford the price of my hard
labour so I had to turn down the offer.
I first released this game back in 1993 for Windows 3.1 (16bit) and ported it to 32bit in 1995 for Windows 95..
Thanks to the amazing backward compatibility of Windows it still runs just fine on all subsequent versions of Windows!
