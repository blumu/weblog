Domenico
--------

This is a small game where you must match icons. There are multiple difficulty levels. It's even more addictive than Windows Minesweeper. Bill Gates has once contacted me and proposed me to release it with 
~~Windows 98~~ Windows Vista. Unfortunately for him, he was not rich enough to afford the price of my labour so I had to turn down the offer.

NetNotifier
-----------

When you are wired to the Internet via a shared phone connection, you don't know when the connexion is opened or closed. This tool tells you when the connection is available by playing a sound and showing you an icon in the tray notification bar.
[Read the short manual](NetNotifier.html).
