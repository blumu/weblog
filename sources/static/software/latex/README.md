The pstring LaTeX package
=========================

This package lets you typeset justiÔ¨Åed sequences, also called pointing strings.
It's used for instance, in research papers about Game Semantics to represent sequence of game moves
with their associated justification pointers.

See [http://william.famille-blum.org/software/latex/]() for latest information about this package.

Tested with MikTeX on Windows. It was reported to work on other platform as well but I have not tested it myself.

Package dependencies

The following packages are required when compiling with `latex` to postscript:

If compiling to PDF using `pdflatex` then the `PGF`/`tikz` packages are used instead to render
the pointers:
