## Lambda calculus traversal evaluator

Implementations of lambda calculus term evaluation algorithm from the TCS paper Evaluating lambda terms with traversals. 

- TypeScript and Rust: https://github.com/blumu/travnorm
- F# and Ocaml: https://github.com/blumu/dphil.tools/tree/master/HOG

## Higher-Order Grammars visualizer and converter (HOG)

A tool for constructing structures generated by higher-order recursion schemes and collapsible pushdown automata. It is also a pedagogic tool for teaching Game semantics and the theory of traversals (cf. my DPhil thesis).

## Size-Change Terminator
A termination analysis tool for a Core ML subset based on size-change termination.
This tool was developped as part of my Master project on [Termination analysis of lambda calculus and a subset of core ML](../#mscthesis). See the [dissertation thesis](../mscthesis.pdf) for explanations on how to use the tool.

## Omake rules for C\# and F\#

I have created some useful rules to compile C\# and F\# projects using the
[OMake build system.](http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html)
