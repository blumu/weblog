Tools

### HOG
A tool for constructing structures generated by higher-order recursion schemes and collapsible pushdown automata. It is also a pedagogic tool for teaching Game semantics and the theory of traversals (cf. my DPhil thesis).

 | [Binary](../hog_exe.zip)
 | [F\#/OCaml sources](../hog_src.zip) (Requires .NET 2.0).

### SCT
A termination analysis tool for a Core ML subset based on size-change termination.
This tool was developped as part of my Master project on [Termination analysis of lambda calculus and a subset of core ML](../#mscthesis). See the [dissertation thesis](../mscthesis.pdf) for explanations on how to use the tool.

### Omake rules for C\# and F\#

I have created some useful rules to compile C\# and F\# projects using the
[OMake build system.](http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html)
