	<h2>Game semantics</h2>
	<p>
	One of the contribution of my DPhil is a novel presentation of Game Semantics based on a generalization of the theory of traversals introduced by Ong. The <a href="APAL-localbeta.pdf">unpublished technical report (pdf)</a> contains the full technical details. The concepts are summarized in <a href="galop08-slides.pdf">the deck (pdf)</a> of the talk I gave at Galop 2008.

	<h2>Higher-order recursion schemes</h2>
	<p>
	The study of the safety restriction led me to the study of higher-order recursion schemes. In an unpublished paper I showed that the type homogeneity constraint included as part of the original definition by Knapik et al. is in fact not necessary. The 12-page <a href="safecpda.pdf">proof (pdf)</a> consists in a game semantic argument based on the theory of traversals which is presented in details in my DPhil thesis.

	<h2>The safe lambda calculus</h2>
	<p>My DPhil concerns the study of a syntactic constraint for higher-order computations called the safety restiction. I refer you to the thesis on the <a href="http://william.famille-blum.org/research/publications.html">publication page</a> for the nitty gritty details.</p>

	<h2>Termination analysis of higher-order programs</h2>
	<p>Based on the work of Jones and Bohr, I propose an extension of the size-change principle introduced by Lee, Jones and Ben-Amram to a subset of ML featuring ground type values, higher-order type values and recursively defined functions. This constitutes the first attempt to adapt the size-change principle to a higher-order functional language ala ML featuring <span class="source">if-then-else</span> branching and <span class="source">let rec</span> definitions. I have implemented a tool based on the this work which is able to prove termination of non-trivial higher-order programs of both ground and higher-order types. This gives a termination decision tool for some subset of recursively defined function on natural numbers.<br /> This is research was pursued as part of my Master in Computer Science (2004).
