I have discovered another problem and I propose to mention it on Your website:

1. History: I took the directory containing my <morphokurs.tex> with me and I worked on it during the weekend. Back to office I synchronized the directories, recompiled the text on the desktop and:

--> forward and reverse search gave completely erroneous behavior (jump to a wrong line).

I deleted all secondary files (<clean all> within Emacs/Auctex), no change of misbehavior.

Then I deleted the subdirectory <auto>, which is generated once the text is changed by editing. I recompiled and:

--> forward and reverse search work as they should do.

2. Workaround: if forward and/or inverse search function with false results:

--> delete secondary files AND the <auto> subdirectory.

3. I do not understand why sumatra-forward and SumatraPdf behave like that, maybe You know a real solution instead of a workaround.

(deleting this <auto> subdir helped in other cases too, but I do not enough remember the situations).

Sincerely

Thomas Binder


Addendum

Another way may be to change anything in the Latex source and then to recompile, because this causes generating a new <auto> subdir and/or to change the contents, solely recompiling the source without editing it does not write changes in <auto>.
